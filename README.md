Read [Awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/amas) AMAS.
=======
I love reading amas of some of the [Awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/amas) people. It's pretty annoying when I have to open each issue in a new tab. So using Github Api and angularjs I have made this.

## TODO

- [x] Add a show more button and load the next page.
- [x] Better UI.
- [x] Should only list closed issues as those are the answered ones.
- [x] Needs to render Markdown.
- [ ] It's currently pretty slow from clicking the title to seeing the comment. The moment the page has loaded, it should          start   preloading the comments in the background.
- [ ] Clicking a new title should close the previous, like an accordion widget.
- [ ] Would be cool to list all the top AMAs(based on no. of issues closed) from https://github.com/sindresorhus/amas below the search on the front-page.
