# ReadAMA
I love reading amas of some of the [Awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/amas) people. It's pretty annoying when I have to open each issue in a new tab. So using Github Api and angularjs I have made this.

## TODO
  * Add a show more button and load the next page. 
  * Better UI.
  * <del> Should only list closed issues as those are the answered ones.</del>
  * Only display the author response, not other comments.
  * Needs to render Markdown.
  * The styling could use some work. The titles are the bright, making it hard to read. Maybe use Bootstrap or something.
  * <del> Drop the list numbers 1:. It doesn't matter. </del>
  * <del> Don't capitalize the default username in the search input. <del>
  * It's currently pretty slow from clicking the title to seeing the comment. The moment the page has loaded, I would start *   preloading the comments in the background.
  * Clicking a new title should close the previous, like an accordion widget.
  * The headings need more line-height.
  * Would be cool to list all the AMAs from https://github.com/sindresorhus/amas below the search on the front-page.
  * When searching the URL should change, so I can copy the URL to get back to that user's AMA. Example: http://akashnimare.in/ReadAMA/sindresorhus
