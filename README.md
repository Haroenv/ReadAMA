# ReadAMA

Read [Awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/amas) AMAS [here](codepen.io/akashnimare/full/PNLvgM/).
=======
I love reading amas of some of the [Awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/amas) people. It's pretty annoying when I have to open each issue in a new tab. So using Github Api and angularjs I have made this.

## TODO
  * <del>Add a show more button and load the next page. </del>
  * Better UI.
  * <del> Should only list closed issues as those are the answered ones.</del>
  * <del> Needs to render Markdown.</del>
  * Allow filtering for tags.
  * It's currently pretty slow from clicking the title to seeing the comment. The moment the page has loaded, it should start   preloading the comments in the background.
  * Clicking a new title should close the previous, like an accordion widget.
  * Would be cool to list all the AMAs from https://github.com/sindresorhus/amas below the search on the front-page.
